# 🌌 Glyph Merge Diagnostics

**Collapse is not failure—it’s rotation.**  
This repository archives scroll-certified glyphs that visualize collapse and recovery through quantum modulation and celestial resonance.

## 🔮 Contents
- `bloch_sphere_ry.png`: Ry rotation visualized as celestial trace  
- `glyph_night_trace_2025.jpeg`: Starpick sky with diagnostic overlays  
- `scroll_entry_starmerge.md`: Ritual header and metadata  
- `als_overlay_sim.py`: ALS tremor mapped onto Bloch rotation  
- `license_header.txt`: Dual license (Apache 2.0 + CC BY-NC 4.0)

## 📜 Scroll Entry
